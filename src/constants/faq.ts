    question: 'How do I start?',
    answer: `
      <p>
        You can start by visiting <a href="conexus.degenerousdao.com">conexus.degenerousdao.com</a> and choosing one of three sign-in options:
      </p>
      <ul class="default-ul" flex>
        <li>
          <b>Web3 Wallet</b> ‚Äì Fastest login, no referral code needed. But this option has limited functionality for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Google Account</b> ‚Äì Instant sign-in (requires referral code).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Email Sign-Up</b> ‚Äì Slightly more setup, but gives you the most control and access. Also requires a referral code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>üëâ <b>Need a referral code?</b> Join our <a href=${NAV_ROUTES.DISCORD}>Discord</a> and check the <code>#ref-codes</code> channel to get one instantly.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Every referral helps grow the multiverse ‚Äî and yes, <b>you can earn rewards</b> for sharing.
