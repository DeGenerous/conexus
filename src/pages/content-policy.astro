    <h2>CoNexus Content Policy</h2>
    <article>
      We believe in creative freedom and want you to feel free to tell bold,
      exciting, and personal stories. These guidelines are here to keep our
      platform safe, respectful, and legally compliant — without limiting your
      imagination unnecessarily.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can create and publish stories that include mature themes, including sexual
      content, strong language, or violence — <b
        >as long as they do not promote real-world harm.</b
      >
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>You may NOT publish content that:</b>
      <ol class="default-ol">
        <li>
          Promotes hate or violence toward people based on race, ethnicity,
          nationality, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or
          similar characteristics.
        </li>

        <li>
          Incites or glorifies real-world violence, terrorism, or self-harm.
        </li>

        <li>
          Contains sexual content involving anyone under the age of 18
          (including fictional depictions).
        </li>

        <li>
          Includes non-consensual sexual content (including glorification of
          sexual assault).
        </li>

        <li>Encourages illegal activity that could cause real harm.</li>
        <li>
          Contains personally identifying information about real people without
          their permission.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <b>What’s OK:</b>
      <ol class="default-ol">
        <li>Erotic or romantic content between consenting adults.</li>

        <li>Violence or dark themes in a fictional setting.</li>

        <li>
          Satire, parody, or controversial ideas, as long as they don’t cross
          into targeted hate or incitement.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <b>What happens if content breaks these rules:</b>
      <ol class="default-ol">
        <li>It may be removed or not approved for public release.</li>

        <li>
          Repeat or severe violations may result in account suspension. We
          reserve the right to remove or restrict any content or terminate user
          accounts at our sole discretion.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      We want you to have fun, take creative risks, and explore challenging ideas
      — just do it in a way that doesn’t put real people in danger or promote hate.
