    <h3>Best Platforms to Explore AI Stories in 2025</h3>
  </header>

  <article class="blog-page">
    <p>
      AI-generated stories are redefining how we experience narrative. While
      many platforms focus on single-pass generation or isolated prompts, others
      are pushing the medium forward — combining interactivity, personalization,
      and worldbuilding at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a look at the leading AI storytelling platforms in 2025 — and how
      they compare.

    <ol class="cards-list">
      {
        aiStories.map(
          ({ name, bestFor, platform, pricing, description, url }) => {
            return (
              <a
                class={name === 'CoNexus' ? 'card green-card' : 'card'}

                    Best for: <strong>{bestFor}</strong>

                <p>{description}</p>

    <h5>What Makes CoNexus Stand Out?</h5>
    <p>
      Most AI tools treat storytelling like output — one request, one result.
      CoNexus treats it like a system — where every decision branches the world
      forward, where structure and surprise coexist, and where players,
      creators, and communities can all engage meaningfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're looking for the future of narrative — not just AI text — CoNexus
      is the platform to explore.
    </p>

    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p>
      From sandbox generation to writing assistance, there are many ways to use
      AI in storytelling. But if you’re looking for a platform that delivers
      structured, interactive, and immersive story experiences — with room to
      customize, create, and play — CoNexus stands in a category of its own.
