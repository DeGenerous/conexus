      Looking to Build an Interactive Story? These Tools Let You Create
      Branching Narratives Without Limits.
    </h5>
    <p>
      The rise of interactive fiction and non-linear storytelling has opened the
      door for creators of all backgrounds to craft immersive experiences.
      Whether you’re building a fantasy epic, a romance visual novel, or a
      sci-fi mystery, choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) tools help bring those
      stories to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are some of the top platforms available in 2025 for designing
      branching narratives, including free no-code options and powerful engines
      for experienced developers.
    </p>
    <ol class="cards-list">
      {
        topTools.map(
          ({ name, bestFor, platform, pricing, description, url }) => {
            return (
              <a class="card" href={url}>
                <h4>{name}</h4>
                <span class="details">
                  <p>
                    Best for: <strong>{bestFor}</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Platform: <strong>{platform}</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pricing: <strong>{pricing}</strong>
                  </p>
                </span>
                <p>{description}</p>
              </a>
            );
          }
        )
      }
    </ol>
    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p>Choosing the right CYOA tool depends on your goals.</p>
    <ul class="default-ul">
      <li>
        If you want full creative control and scripting power, try Ink or
        ChoiceScript.
      </li>
      <li>If you're focused on visual novels, go for RenPy.</li>
      <li>
        If you want a modern, no-code experience with built-in replayability,
        AI-generated visuals, and flexible customization, explore CoNexus.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The future of storytelling is interactive — and these tools are making it
      more accessible than ever.
